# artflipsaver-win
It's like the iTunes album art screensaver, but for Rdio.

## What?
This is a Windows screensaver that displays [artflip](https://github.com/endenizen/artflip)

## Thanks
This project is basically just a wrapper around the [artflip app](https://github.com/endenizen/artflip).
Thanks to endenizen for his hard work.

## TODO:
* get an app that shows a config dialog
* get an app that saves the configs to the registry (or appdata?)
* get an app that loads a web page
* tests/tdd!
* can we get CI?
* write list of requirements in readme.md (C# + winX?)
* figure out distribution (where is the .scr file hosted?)
* figure out installation (most likely just a gif that shows a drag&drop of the .scr in the /windows folder)
