# artflipsaver-win [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/uxxv0xdud2juspgx?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gbranchaud/artflipsaver-win)
It's like the iTunes album art screensaver, but for Rdio.

## What?
This is a Windows screensaver that displays your top Rdio albums.

## Thanks
* This project is basically just a wrapper around the [artflip app](https://github.com/endenizen/artflip). Thanks to endenizen for his hard work.
* This [C# screen saver tutorial](http://www.harding.edu/fmccown/screensaver/screensaver.html) proved very useful.

## TODO
* get an app that shows a config dialog
* get an app that saves the configs to the registry (or appdata?)
* get an app that renders a web page
* get an app that shows a config dialog
* get an app that shows the same web page on each monitor (no blank screens)
* tests/tdd!
* write required + build instructions in readme.md (C#, min Win ver., one-command build process, etc.)
* add screenshot of working screensaver in readme.md
* figure out distribution (where is the .scr file hosted? appveyor?)
* figure out installation (most likely just a gif that shows a drag&drop of the .scr in the /windows folder)
