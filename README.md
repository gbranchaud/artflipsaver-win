It's like the iTunes album art screensaver, but for Rdio.

## What?
This is a Windows screensaver that displays your top Rdio albums.

## Thanks

## TODO
* [x] show the web page in a form
* [x] render the web page using IE11 engine (both when debugging in VS & standalone)
* [x] make the screensaver fullscreen
* [ ] hook events (mousemove ~~+ keyboard~~) to it
* [ ] show config dialog (with rdio username only?)
* [ ] save the config to the registry (or appdata?)
* [ ] support multi-monitor setup (no blank screens)
* [ ] write required + build instructions in readme.md (C#, min Win ver., one-command build process, etc.)
* [ ] add screenshot of working screensaver in readme.md
* [ ] figure out distribution (where is the .scr file hosted? appveyor?)
* [ ] produce installation .gif (i.e. shows a drag&drop of the .scr in the /windows folder)
